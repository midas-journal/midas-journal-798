\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document illustrates how to process large images (6 and 23 Gigabytes in
size) by taking advantage of the streaming capabilities of the Insight Toolkit
ITK v4.  Here we illustrate two scenarios: (a) the case when the image itself is
larger than the computer's RAM, (b) the case when the image is large but still
can fit in the computer's RAM. This report is intended to serve as a tutorial
on how to take advantage of this memory management capabilities of ITK.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

Large images are becoming ubiquitous in many research fields. They are
particularly common in microscopy, remote sensing and computer vision.  Image
sizes are growing at a higher rate than the size of computer memory and
therefore there is a great interest in software methods that allow to process
images by partitioning in pieces that can temporarily be fit into memory. Such a
process is commonly denoted as streaming.

In this technical report we illustrate how this can be done with the
infrastructure of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) version 4. For this matter, first we do a
brief explanation of the main concepts involved in the ITK streaming process
(section~\ref{sec:stream}). Then, we make use of two trabecular bone micro-CT images
(6 and 23 Gigabytes in size) from the Creatis collection of the MIDAS
database~\cite{Zuluaga2011a} to develop an example of the streaming procedure
(section~\ref{sec:implementation}). The latter example is accompagnied by
reported results (section~\ref{sec:results}), as the source code
that permits its validation as required by \textbf{reproducible research
standards}~\cite{Stodden2009}.

\subsection{Pipeline Basics}
Figure~\ref{fig:StreamingFigure1} Illustrates the most basic pipeline in ITK.
In this case only composed of a reader and a writer. They are respectively the
\doxygen{ImageFileReader} and \doxygen{ImageFileWriter}. When not using streaming,
the data flows through the pipeline when the method \code{Update()} is called in
the writer class. At that point, there is a first negotiation between the filters
in the pipeline, in which the filters at the front, in this case the writer, ask
their predecessors about the largest size of image that they can generate. In this
simple example, the request gets to the reader, and in turn triggers internally
the call to \code{ReadImageInformation()} on the ImageIO class corresponding to
the image file format. The \code{ReadImageInformation} method gathers information
from the image header without loading the actual pixel data into memory. In this
way it can determine the size of the image \code{LargestPossibleRegion} and can
pass it downstream to the subsequent filters. In the simple non-streaming case,
the writer receives this information about \code{LargestPossibleRegion} and
proceeds to request it all in a single piece. This is done internally by
setting the \code{RequestedRegion} to be equal to the
\code{LargestPossibleRegion} and asking the previous filter to generate that
\code{RequestedRegion}. In this scenario, the reader now receives this request,
and proceeds to load the full image into memory. Then to pass that image to the
writer. At this point a full copy of the image data is moved from disk into the
RAM memory. Note that the writer itself does not generate another copy, it
simply accesses the memory buffer of the image generated by the reader.


\subsection{Streaming Mechanisms}

In ITK, streaming is the process of dividing the data into regions and then
processing this data through the data pipeline~\cite{Ibanez2005}. Let us recall
that a pipeline consists of process objects that generate data objects connected
in the pipeline topology. The execution of this pipeline requires that the
associated filters perform several functions that involve memory allocation,
initialization, data request and update, among others. We refere the interested
reader to \cite{Ibanez2005} for further details on the pipeline managing
functions.


The whole pipeline managing process is controlled by the request for data of
a particular size. It might occur that the user requires to process an enlarged
input region (i.e. a Median filter that uses a 5x5 kernel, when requested for
region 100x100, will pass a request for 104 x 104 pixels) or that data is required
to be divided into several pieces. For this matter, every filter implements (or
inherits) a \verb+GenerateInputInformation()+ method which defines the input
region a filter needs in order to produce the requested output region.

One of the advantages of ITK architecture is that the pipeline management execution
system is designed into the system. This means that no significant changes occur
in the coding of a pipeline using streaming and one that does not. Moreover, ITK's
streaming architecture allows to benefit from multithreading without the requiring
to introduce code modifications. If a filter is multi-threaded, then subsets
of the memory block will be assigned to separate cores.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}
The example we develop illustrates the pipeline executed in order to segment
osteocyte lacunae from trabecular bone images. Osteocyte lacunae appear as small
dark pores inside white larger structures (Figure \ref{fig:ImageOne}). A simple pipeline
to extract these dark pores consists of: 1) Image binarization, 2)
Hole-filling on the binarized image and 3) Subtraction of the hole-filled and
the binarized images.  In the following, we present the different stages of the
pipeline and how the whole process can be streamed.

\subsection{Reading and Writing}
A key requirement in order to perform such task through the partitioning of
images is that the \doxygen{ImageIO} classes involved in the pipeline support
streamed reading and writing. Otherwise, the entire image will be buffered
in memory~\cite{Lowekamp2010}.

The following code illustrates the reading of a large image that is then written
into another file. While this is the simplest case that can be illustrated, it
contains the core elements that are required to perform streaming.

First we include the headers:

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={21-23}]{../../src/ImageReadStreamWrite.cxx}
\end{center}

Then, we instantiate the reader and writer.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={46-47}]{../../src/ImageReadStreamWrite.cxx}
\end{center}

In order to trigger the use of streaming, it is necessary to specify to the
writer into how many blocks the image should be partitioned. In that sense, the
most important line in the streaming process is:

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={57-57}]{../../src/ImageReadStreamWrite.cxx}
\end{center}

Finally, we use the standard try / catch block that calls the Update method and
triggers the whole process.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={68-76}]{../../src/ImageReadStreamWrite.cxx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Binary Thresholding}
The first filter used in the segmentation pipeline is a binary thresholding
(threshold = 128 for image 1 and 2.3 for image 2) that
allows to differentiate the osteocytes from the rest of the image. In this example,
we connected a binary thresholding filter between the reader and the writer.

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={48-59}]{../../src/BinaryThresholdImageFilter.cxx}
\end{center}

As can be seen from the following code, there is no significant difference
between the previous example and this one in order to activate the streaming.
The streaming process is still driven by the writer:

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={79-79}]{../../src/BinaryThresholdImageFilter.cxx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Noise Elimination and Filling-Up Holes}
It is important to differentiate the streaming concept from multithreading. While
streaming refers to the process of sequentially processing sub-regions part of
the largest possible region) of an image through the pipeline~\cite{Lowekamp2010},
multithreading refers to the possibility of making use of the multiple cores of
a computer to do the processing.

In ITK, not all filters supporting streaming support the use of multi-threading.
Such is the case of ITK's morphological filters, which are commonly used for hole
filling. Therefore, we have selected to use \doxygen{VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter},
for the hole filling task, instead of the morphological filters, since the former
supports both streaming and multithreading.

The key elements required to make use of  \doxygen{VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter}
are shown in the following:

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={44-65}]{../../src/VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter.cxx}
\end{center}

Depending on the foreground and background values that are provided to the
filter, it can perform hole filling or noise removal from the background (see
Figure \ref{fig:ImageTwo}).  We have used it here for both purposes.

We recall again in the fact that there is only a single code line that
need to be included to activate the streaming:

\begin{center}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={74-74}]{../../src/VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter.cxx}
\end{center}

On the other hand, nothing needs to be added in order to activate the multi-threading.
If the filter allows the use of multiple cores, it will make use of them.

\subsection{Subtraction}
The final stage of the pipeline consists in the subtraction of  a noise-free
version of the binarized image from the hole-filled image. The resulting image contains the
segmented osteocytes. The implementation
of this stage is straightforward and it has no additional difficulty in what
respects to the streaming. For the sake of completeness, we limit ourselves to
just mention this stage here but, we do not include a code example in the text
of this report.  Of course, we include in the annex materials the source code
that we used for this subtraction operation, as required by
\textbf{reproducible research standards}~\cite{Stodden2009}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We have evaluated the pipeline using two different images from the Creatis collection
in the MIDAS database\cite{Zuluaga2011a} with respective sizes of 6 and 23 Gigabytes. One of the requirements
of the selected images is that they come on the MetaImage format which can be processed with streaming. Not every
image format accepts such possibility.
Figures~\ref{fig:ImageOne} and \ref{fig:ImageTwo} show the results obtained at different
stages of the pipeline.

\label{fig:ImageTwo}
\end{figure}

We should mention that, as can be seen from figures~\ref{fig:ImageOne} and
\ref{fig:ImageTwo}, the hole-filling process requires the iterative execution of
the voting filter. While ITK provides a \doxygen{VotingBinaryIterativeHoleFillingImageFilter}
that iterates until all the image holes are filled, we select to use the simpler
\doxygen{VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter} since it permits the use of streaming
and multithreading.

The whole pipeline was tested on an Dual Core Intel Centrino with 4Gb in RAM. For the image of 6GB (image 1),
the data was partitioned into 6 different blocks. For the 23 Gb image (image 2), the data was partitioned into
10 different blocks. Given $f$ the number of filters involved
in a processing pipeline and $s$ the size in (bytes) of a slice, a simple rule that can be
used to estimate the desired number of partitions $p$,  should be

\begin{equation}
  \frac{f*s}{p} < RAM
\end{equation}

Afterwards, a trade-off between the speed of the process and the number of partitions
should be evaluated. As the number of partitions increases, the pipeline execution will
take longer, unless a sufficient number of CPU cores is available. As an example,
Table~\ref{table:times} summarizes the computational times of each stage of the pipeline
with the two evaluated images.

and multithreading capabilities of the Insight Toolkit can be exploited to
process image larger than the computer RAM.
